Hi,

Pretty quiet day here today. I'm not sure exactly what got done today, but the hours passed and it is almost time for bed. 

Seuss and I tried to work on some skills we have been practicing... some with success and some not! I always know when I am being confusing as Seuss barks to show his frustration. I mean, don't we all? We did make some progress at the end, though I'm not quite sure where to go next, or if we are even going in the right direction. As much as humans and dogs have evolved to be able to understand each other, sometimes I wish we had a simpler shared language. He can do all the things I want him to do, if only he knew what I wanted! It probably doesn't help that I always seem to want him to do such strange things. at least from his point of view. For example, we have been working on his alert, which is how he tells me when he finds something. At the moment he usually sits and looks at me. I would prefer if he sat and stared at the target, since this is helpful for me when I'm trying to see what he is smelling. One of the exercises we have been working on is for him to sit and stare at one of his toys. All goes smoothly when I am holding the toy, or touching it, or pointing at it. But I can't seem to take my hand away without him then looking at me. Anyway, much work and frustration! Well, tonight after our walk when I was out closing the chicken door, I turn to see that Seuss has hung his frisbee on the chicken fence and is patiently staring at it! If only there was a way to say to him: "You know that strange thing we keep practicing inside? This is it!" When I sit back and think about it, who knows what things Seuss has been trying to teach me to do that I am not picking up on. I think of the two of us he is the faster learner!

Today's photo is of Revi practicing her version of yoga. I have been doing quite a bit of yoga over the last two months and am slowly getting more flexible, but I think Revi is a natural.

Hugs,<br />
